# Dotfiles
A collection of my configuration files mostly for neovim and zsh.

I am using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage them.

## Scripts
This repository contains scripts to install and uninstall my configs on a fresh
system. While you should definitely not use them, feel free to have a look and
get some inspiration :)

## License
Public domain. By the way, can you *really* license config files?
